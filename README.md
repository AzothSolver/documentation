# 🧾 AzothSolver Documentation

Welcome to the **AzothSolver Documentation Hub** — the central reference point for the architecture, design rationale, and operational guidelines behind the AzothSolver system.

AzothSolver is a performance-oriented solver designed for the [CoW Protocol](https://cow.fi/), with a strong focus on latency reduction, pathfinding accuracy, and alignment with protocol incentives and shadow competition mechanics.

## 📚 Documentation Structure

This repository contains both high-level overviews and in-depth technical documents:

### 📄 Whitepaper
- [`AzothSolver-Whitepaper.pdf`](../assets/documents/AzothSolver-Whitepaper.pdf): Formal project overview including latency objectives, architecture, and roadmap.
- [`AzothSolver-Whitepaper.md`](../assets/documents/AzothSolver-Whitepaper.md): Markdown version (useful for linking or diffing updates).

### ⚙️ Core Architecture
- `architecture/`: Rust-based modular solver design, outlining:
  - Data ingestion and decoding
  - Quote generation and objective functions
  - Auction submission interface (CoW Protocol shadow mode)
- `infrastructure/`: Description of latency-leveraged deployment location, real-time networking stack, and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).

### 🧠 Protocol Alignment
- `cow-protocol/`: Documentation about:
  - CoW auction structure and CIP integration (CIP-67, CIP-DRAFT, CIP-11)
  - Solver submission expectations
  - Fairness, incentive alignment, and MEV-blocking goals

### 🧪 Performance & Testing
- `benchmarking/`: Scripts and notes on solver performance tests.
- `shadow-competition/`: Real-time solving behavior, with examples and diagnostics.
