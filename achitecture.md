## 🧱 Module Breakdown

### 1. **Auction Listener**
- Subscribes to CoW Protocol auctions via HTTP polling or WebSocket (when available).
- Decodes auction data (`orders`, `tokens`, `fee`) into internal format.

### 2. **Quote Generator**
- Core logic to identify optimal trade paths and token pairs.
- Supports future plug-in design for multiple algorithm strategies (e.g., baseline, fallback, custom heuristic).

### 3. **Objective Evaluator**
- Applies constraints and scoring rules:
  - Min surplus violation
  - Fee target compliance
  - Path validity
- Modular scoring functions for experimentation (e.g. CoW-maximization vs solver-centric strategies).

### 4. **Auction Builder**
- Converts successful quote + evaluation into a valid `QuoteSubmission` per CoW spec.
- Prepares payload with signature, quote ID, and solution JSON.

### 5. **Submission Engine**
- Manages request throttling and retry logic.
- Sends quote to CoW Protocol driver (in shadow mode).

### 6. **Monitoring & Metrics**
- Exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics for:
  - Quoting latency
  - Submission success/failure
  - Path computation time
- Optional Grafana dashboards planned for Q4 2025.

## 🚧 In Progress

- [ ] Benchmark pathfinding engine using synthetic auctions
- [ ] Add signature auth for CoW solver registration
- [ ] CIP-aligned quote evaluation scoring function
- [ ] Enable fallback quote path modules (e.g., 0x RFQ, Base liquidity)
